File System Simulation  



The default sizes for the simulated filesystem are to use 512B blocks with a 64kB capacity. If a block size or a disk size are not given, a warning will be thrown to notify the user of the default values. If files are too big to fit in remaining space, an error will be thrown and the file will be skipped.
